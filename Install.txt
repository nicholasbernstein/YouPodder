# This program will download a video from youtube using it's URL
# It will then create a mp3 version of the file
# Lastly it will add "bumpers" to the mp3 and save it as out.mp3 

----------------------
Installing
----------------------

# Download & install python 3.7 or later from python.org (probably works with other versions, but 3.7 was tested)

# Run the following commmands in a terminal/command prompt to install required python modules:
# (modules only need to be installed the first time)

pip install pytube
pip install moviepy
pip install requests

----------------------
Running the command
----------------------

# Copy two mp3 files to the directory where this script is located.
# call one pre.mp3
# call the other post.mp3

# Once you have installed the modules: 

Run the command: "cd path"
	- where path is the path to the folder this program is in (eg: c:\YouPodder\ or ~/Downloads/YouPodder)
	- on mac systems you can drag the folder onto the terminal and that will insert the path

run the command: 	
	 python.exe .\extract_audio.py https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=?????????
